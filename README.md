# To Find The Probablity of Mercedes Winning Russian GP 2019

In this project, we create a python script to find the winning probablity of mercedes the russian grand prix looking at the score after singapore grand prix.


Goal: To check how certain conditional events affect the probability distribution. 


We create a probablity distribution function  based on the point table.
Then we create the necessary function to calculate the conditional probablity of certain event taking place.
Conditions: 
 1) Probability for Mercedes to win both races
 ```
 0.12188950138590415
 ```
 2) Probability for Mercedes to win at least one race
  ```
 0.5764216739671665
 ```
 3) If Mercedes wins the first race, probability that Mercedes wins the next one
  ```
 0.3446697187704381
 ```
 4) Mercedes wins at least one of these two races, probability Mercedes wins both races
  ```
 0.21145891435173045
 ```
 5) Probability Mercedes wins both races in any weather conditions (Assuming 5 conditions)
  ```
 0.2893805802888808
 ```
